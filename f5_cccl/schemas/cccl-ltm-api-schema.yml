  The CCCL "Cecil" library allows clients to define services that describe
  LTM resources on a managed partition of the BIG-IP.  The managed resources
  are defined in this schema definitions section.

  The structure of the service definition is a collection of lists of
  supported resources.  Initially this is virtual addresses; virtual servers;
  pools and pool members; L7 policies, rules, actions and conditions; health
  monitors; and iApps.

  Where appropriate some basic constraints are defined by the schema; however,
  not all actual constraints can be enforced by the schema.  It is the
  responsibility of the client application to ensure that all dependencies
  among the specified resources are met; otherwise, the service will be deployed
  in a degraded state.

      virtual server.  For example, a virtual server that has a shared virtual address that
      lives in the Common partition or in the case of OpenStack were the creation of a VIP
      is separate from the listener(virtual server)

      All actions apply to requests only, request must always be present and set to 'True'.

      For foward actions, either 'pool' or 'reset' must be defined, but not both.
      If the forward to pool attribute is set, then the full path of the pool must be
      provided.  If the 'reset' attribute is 'True', the request will be blocked.

      For redirect actions, the 'location' attribute must point to a valid URI path.
